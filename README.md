# CrossHost

Multi-platform social service.

CrossHost is a Swift-based server platform that abstracts multiple underlying social services. The goal here is interoperability with low-cost hosting.

Optimizing for cost is tricky, because different people have access to different hosting arrangements. This is why CrossHost is implemented as a library. The idea is to abstract out enough of the underlying dependencies so that multiple concrete hosting implementations are supported.

Services:

- [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks)
- [ATProto](https://atproto.com)

Implementations:

- [AWS lambda](https://github.com/mattmassicotte/CrossHostAWS)

## Integration

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/mattmassicotte/CrossHost", branch: "main")
]
```

## Contribution and Collaboration

I would love to hear from you! Issues or pull requests work great. A [Discord server][discord] is also available for live help, but I have a strong bias towards answering in the form of documentation.

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.
